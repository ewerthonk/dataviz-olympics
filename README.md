## 👨🏻‍🏫 Description

A **visual** exploratory data analysis of 🇧🇷 Brazil 🇧🇷 at the Olympic Games using the ```athlete_events.csv``` dataset.

The goal here was to practice data visualization skills. The notebook explores a few questions:

- Is there any correlation between an athlete's height and his/her performance for any sports?
- Do you think taller Basketball Brazil Teams perform better than the smaller? What about footbal? What would be a good Volleyball Team average height?
- What would be a good visualization to show, by sport, the proportion of gold, silver, and bronze medals Brazil have earned?
- How was Brazil's evolution in earned medals through time?

**Important:** The notebook uses Plotly (check the hovers!) to create the charts. So, they will not be rendered directly on Github view. The link above redirects you to nbviewer.
